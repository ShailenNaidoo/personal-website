<p class="lead"> Hello, I'm <strong>Shailen Naidoo</strong> â€” an open-source enthusiast, JavaScript developer,

  <h2>My passions</h2>
  <p> I am fortunate enough to have two passions, I have been playing guitar for close to 10 years and programming
    for the last 4 - 5 years. My focus is to make the Web more accessible to the undeserved communities in South
    Africa. </p>
  <p></p>
  <h2>Community</h2>
  <p>Giving back to the dev community is very important to me.</p>
  <p>I am the co-organizer of Vue.js South Africa which was started back in December 2018, we typically have 30+
    attendees to the meetups.</p>
  <p> In addition to organising community events I also speak at conferences and meetups and have run a number of
    workshops. These include:
