    Hello, I'm <strong>Shailen Naidoo</strong> â€” an open-source enthusiast, JavaScript developer, speaker and tech community organiser. 
    I am currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://lumkani.com">Lumkani</a>, an insure-tech company that builds network connected fire alarms for townships.

    <h2>My passions</h2>
    <p>
      I am fortunate enough to have two passions, I have been playing guitar for close to 10 years and programming for the last 4 years.
      My focus is to make the Web more accessible to the undeserved communities in South Africa.
    </p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>Teaching</h2>
    <p>
      I regularly teach JavaScript at the <a href="https://codespace.co.za">CodeSpace Academy</a> when I am free, I have also hosted workshops on technologies such as <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a> and <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> and regularly give advice on Web Technologies on online forums
    </p>

    <h2>Community</h2>
    <p>Giving back to the dev community is very important to me.</p>

    <p>I am the co-organizer of Vue.js South Africa which was started back in December 2018, we typically have 30+ attendees to the meetups.</p>

    <p>
      In addition to organising community events I also speak at conferences and meetups and have run a number of workshops. 
      These include:
      <ul>
