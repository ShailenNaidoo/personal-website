Oh, hey! You’re still here, good for you! You should know I’m passionate about web development and that doesn’t just mean standards; I’m an advocate for anything and anyone that contributes to good quality web development.

I’ve worked as a front-end developer on some of Australia’s largest websites as well as some of the smallest community sites. When I’m not building sites or blogging I like to experiment with code. I love learning new things and finding techniques that challenge what we think is best practice. Although very few ideas make it into my production toolkit, I find experimentation is the best way learn and the only way to discover new techniques.

I try to share everything I learn, I speak, I blog and sometimes help organise community events & meetups.

I build innovative applications, data visualisations and websites. I want to make amazing user experiences that focus on quality, performance and great design, with built-in accessibility. I write maintainable, future-proof code with the latest tools and techniques.

I'm a skilled engineer. I'm comfortable with tools such as React, Node, ES6, Webpack etc. but I don't like listing tools and libraries. I am comfortable learning new languages, libraries and tools when required. I have done this before and I will no doubt have to do it again.

I'm a creative, innovative and dedicated developer. I have a deep understanding front-end technologies such as CSS and SVG, but also of the web as a platform. I know how browsers work. I read specifications and so many blog posts. There is a good chance I know how to solve specific problems or where to find the answer.

I am an effective team builder. I've led teams. I've worked remotely and I'm a mentor in my community. I've worked for myself, in small agencies and in large corporate environments. I know the many shapes teams can take and how to be effective in each case. I value diversity that's why I help organise a program called CodeBar in Sydney to support underrepresented groups in tech. I don't just build teams I build community. I can do this for you too.

I'm adaptable. I've worked on some of Australia's largest websites as well as the smallest community sites. I've built websites, applications and data visualisations on numerous platforms.

I have spoken at dozens of conferences and community-level events around Australia, Europe, UK, and the US. I have written numerous technical articles some of which are here on my personal blog, as well as on websites like Smashing Magazine and Codrops.
