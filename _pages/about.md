I am a designer and front-end developer currently working as head of design at [NML](https://nml.co.za), a specialist financial services software development company in Cape Town.



He loves applying user-centered design principles to front-end development. That means he designs and develops sites and web apps in a future friendly way: with an eye towards inclusive design, accessibility, and performance.

He’s been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). He works with small teams on big problems, in Cape Town, South Africa.

Me helping a speaker at the UX SA conference

He’s been building things for the web professionally since 2005 (and built things for fun for a while before that). In the past few years he’s worked as a front-end developer and UX person at Unboxed Consulting, Flow (now part of Deloitte Digital), and Praekelt Foundation. He’s also worked as a code mentor at codeX, helping people learn front-end and back-end development. In October 2016, he went back to consulting full-time. Since then, he’s worked with teams at Vulcan Labs, Fire and Lion, Code Collective, Isoflow, SnapScan and more.

He enjoys sharing what he’s learned from all the mistakes he’s made, so he writes about it, speaks at conferences, and facilitates workshops. If he’s not busy with one of those, he’s probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, taking pictures of it.
Elsewhere

He’s on Twitter as @maxbarners, on Medium as @maxbarners, on GitHub as SteveBarnett, on LinkedIn, and on this site as, erm, himself.

He loves open source so he keeps lots of things on GitHub like the contract he uses, the questions he asks clients, a template for lightweight UX Personas, checklists for UX and accessibility, and retrospective templates.

You can drop him a line at hello@naga.co.za. Sometimes he writes things about himself in the third person and it feels a bit odd ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
